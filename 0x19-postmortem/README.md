Benny AI Outage - March 2, 2025

Issue Summary

Duration: March 2, 2025, 14:00 UTC – March 2, 2025, 16:30 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes)

Impact:
	Benny AI’s summarization service was completely unavailable.
	Users were unable to generate summaries for videos, images, and text.
	Approximately 85% of active users were affected, leading to significant disruption in their workflow.
	Panic ensued on social media with users tweeting: "Benny, come back! My productivity depends on you!"
	Root Cause: A database connection failure due to high traffic overload caused API requests to time out, preventing Benny from retrieving and processing user requests.

Timeline

14:00 UTC - Automated monitoring detected a spike in API response times, triggering an alert.
14:05 UTC - Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a network latency problem.
14:15 UTC - Reports from users started appearing on forums and social media about Benny being unresponsive. (Cue the memes!)
14:30 UTC - The engineering team checked the load balancer and server logs, noticing database connection errors.
14:45 UTC - The issue was escalated to the database management team.
15:00 UTC - Engineers attempted to restart database instances, but the issue persisted.
15:20 UTC - Deeper investigation revealed that the high traffic spike exceeded database connection limits, causing a bottleneck.
15:45 UTC - A temporary fix was deployed by increasing database connection limits and adding additional read replicas.
16:15 UTC - API performance improved, and monitoring showed successful query executions.
16:30 UTC - The system was fully restored, and all services were functioning normally. Users rejoiced. 

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause: The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in user requests, which overwhelmed the database connection pool. Benny’s AI system relies on fetching and processing data through multiple APIs, and due to an insufficient database scaling policy, the database reached its connection limit, leading to timeouts and service failure.

Resolution:
	Increased the maximum database connection limits to handle peak traffic.
	Deployed additional read replicas to distribute the load more effectively.
	Implemented a queueing system to manage incoming API requests and prevent overwhelming the database.
	Performed a system-wide cache refresh to reduce dependency on direct database queries.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements & Fixes:
	Enhanced monitoring: Implement better alerting for database connection limits and query response times.
	Auto-scaling policies: Configure database instances to scale dynamically based on traffic.
	Rate limiting: Implement user request throttling to prevent system overload.
	Load balancing optimization: Improve request routing to evenly distribute traffic across database replicas.

Task List:
	Implement database auto-scaling to handle future traffic spikes.
	Improve API caching strategies to reduce frequent database queries.
	Add alerts for high database connection usage to detect issues earlier.
	Optimize query execution times and database indexing for faster performance.
	Conduct a load test simulation to evaluate system performance under peak conditions.
	By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure Benny remains reliable for all users.
